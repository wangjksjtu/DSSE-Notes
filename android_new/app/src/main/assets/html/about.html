        DSSE Notes is an open source project available at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wangjksjtu/DSSE-Notes">https://github.com/wangjksjtu/DSSE-Notes</a>&nbsp;and
        readme file is in the same directory <span style="color:#0099cc;"></span>

    <p>
        DSSE Notes seek to combine the convenience of cloud notes (write once, sync everywhere) and
        the the security of encrypted notes together. The uses can assign common tags to their notes
        and send encrypted notes to the cloud server. Once uploaded, the user can then retrieve the
        encrypted notes from the server and decrypt it locally. User can also perform remote search
        by providing tags. The server will receive the tags, and the send back relevant notes. All the
        data online is encrypted.
